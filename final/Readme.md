# *Analysis 1*

## *Conclusion:*
### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- It is normal trend to believe that terrorist attacks in India occur during festive season 
  when more number of people are gathered together to celebrate the festival.
- The two graphs above shows a contrasting story.
- More or comparable number of attacks occur during non festive season.
- More or comparable number of people dies during non festive season.
- So government should tighten the security throughout the year rather than just during 
  the festive season. 
- It will minimize the number of deaths that happens due to the terrorist attacks throughout the year.

## *Conclusion:*
### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- Not only has the number of terrorism acts increased over time, but also the number of 
  deaths per act has been on the rise. This could possibly due to the fact that there 
  being more densely populated areas over time.
- We can see that terrorism is widespread, but judging by where the points are located, 
  and quite obviously, it mostly affects areas that are more densely populated.

## *Conclusion:*
### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- There are far more successful acts than failed acts. It may mean either :
- Data is not complete and failed terrorist acts are 100% reported.
- The high success rate is real.
- I suspect the reality is a mix between the above two reasons. 
- A failed terrorist acts may not hit the headlines and therefore will be absent from the data.

# *Analysis 5*

## *Target Pattern in Top 4 most affected countries by terrorist attacks (2001 - 2015)*

## *Conclusion:*
### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- The top four most affected countries by terrorist attacks as per wikipedia has more percentage of attacks in 
  normal areas as compared to the attacks on government or militry infrastructure.
- This pattern clearly bifurcate with the terrorist motives to protest against the wrongdoing that 
  they have suffered from the political or militry establishment in a country.
- They are attacking and killing normal innocent people in the name of Jihad.
- These attacks not only make a country poorer but also injest the fearsome feeling of being unsafe.
