### *Conclusion:*
#### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- It is normal trend to believe that terrorist attacks in India occur during festive season 
when more number of people are gathered together to celebrate the festival.
- The two graphs above shows a contrasting story.
- More or comparable number of attacks occur during non festive season.
- More or comparable number of people dies during non festive season.
- So government should tighten the security throughout the year rather than just during 
the festive season. 
- It will minimize the number of deaths that happens due to the terrorist attacks throughout the year.
