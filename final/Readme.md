# *Analysis 1*

## *Festive vs NonFestive Season Attack in India (2001 - 2015)*

### *Steps:*
####
- The csv file containing the Terrorism Data is read.
- Created two seperate datasets containing data related to festive and nonfestive season.
- Computed the attack and death values in festive and nonfestive season.
- Computed the attack and death percentage in festive and nonfestive season.
- Plotted the graph to help better visualize the above information.

### *Outputs:*
- Plot File : [FestiveVsNonFestive](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_1/png/festiveVSnonfestive.png)
- Excel Files : [Terror_Compare](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_1/excel/terror_compare.xlsx)

### *Conclusion:*
#### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- It is normal trend to believe that terrorist attacks in India occur during festive season 
  when more number of people are gathered together to celebrate the festival.
- The two graphs above shows a contrasting story.
- More or comparable number of attacks occur during non festive season.
- More or comparable number of people dies during non festive season.
- So government should tighten the security throughout the year rather than just during 
  the festive season. 
- It will minimize the number of deaths that happens due to the terrorist attacks throughout the year.


# *Analysis 2*

## *Attack Pattern and Global Terrorism (2001 - 2015)*

### *Steps:*
####
- The csv file containing the Terrorism Data is read.
- Computed the number of attacks across the world year wise.
- Computed the number of people died across the world year wise.
- Computed the average number of people died region wise.
- Plotted the graph to help better visualize the above information.

### *Outputs:*
- Plot File : [Attacks&Death](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_2/png/Attacks&Death.png), [AverageNumberofDeaths](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_2/png/AverageNumberofDeaths.png), [GlobalTerrorism](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_2/png/GlobalTerrorism.png)
- Excel Files : [Count_Yearwise](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_2/excel/count_yearwise.xlsx), [Mean_Yearwise](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_2/excel/mean_yearwise.xlsx), [Average_Death](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_2/excel/average_death.xlsx)

### *Conclusion:*
#### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- Not only has the number of terrorism acts increased over time, but also the number of 
  deaths per act has been on the rise. This could possibly due to the fact that there 
  being more densely populated areas over time.
- We can see that terrorism is widespread, but judging by where the points are located, 
  and quite obviously, it mostly affects areas that are more densely populated.
- We can also note, that on average, every terror attack in North America claims 8 lives.


# *Analysis 3*

## *Understand who is committing terrorists attacks, and how are they carrying out these attacks (2001 - 2015)*

### *Steps:*
####
- The csv file containing the Terrorism Data is read.
- Computed the number of attacks across the world based on type of attack.
- Computed the number of people died across the world based on type of attack.
- Filtered the above information for top 4 terrorist groups by top 5 attack type.
- Plotted the graph to help better visualize the above information.

### *Outputs:*
- Plot File : [Terrgroupcounts](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_3/png/terrgroupcounts.png), [terrgrouppattern](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_3/png/terrgrouppattern.png)
- Excel Files : [Attack_Data](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_3/excel/attack_data.xlsx), [Group_Taliban](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_3/excel/Group_Taliban.xlsx), [Group_ISIL](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_3/excel/Group_ISIL.xlsx), [Group_LTTE](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_3/excel/Group_LTTE.xlsx), [Group_Al_Qaida](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_3/excel/Group_Al_Qaida.xlsx)

### *Conclusion:*
#### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- The top 5 attack type is similar for each terrorist group, but level of attack severity varies greatly.
- Majority of attacks by Taliban, LTTE and Al-Qaida is by Bombing/Explosion or by Armed Assault. 
- Majority of attacks by ISIL is by Bombing/Explosion or by Hostage Taking(Kidnapping).
- It clearly draws a picture that if a Bombing/Explosion or Armed Assault attack occurs then there are 
  high chances that it is carried out either by Taliban or by ISIL or by LTTE or by Al-Qaida.
- Most number of Assassination is the work of either Taliban or Al-Qaida
- Additionally, if Hostage Taking(Kidnapping) occurs then there are high chances that it is carried out by
  Taliban or ISIL.
  
  
# *Analysis 4*

## *Success and Failure of Terrorist Attacks (2001 - 2015)*

### *Steps:*
####
- The csv file containing the Terrorism Data is read.
- Computed the number of successful attacks across the world year wise.
- Computed the number of failed attacks across the world year wise.
- Computed the top 10 number of successful attacks and corresponding number of 
  failed attacks across the world country wise.
- Plotted the graph to help better visualize the above information.

### *Outputs:*
- Plot File : [YearWise_Attack_Comparision](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_4/png/YearWise_Attack_Comparision.png), [CountryWise_Attack_Comparision](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_4/png/CountryWise_Attack_Comparision.png)

## *Conclusion:*
### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- There are far more successful acts than failed acts. It may mean either :
   - Data is not complete and failed terrorist acts are 100% reported.
   - The high success rate is real.
- I suspect the reality is a mix between the above two reasons. 
- A failed terrorist acts may not hit the headlines and therefore will be absent from the data.


# *Analysis 5*

## *Target Pattern in Top 4 most affected countries by terrorist attacks (2001 - 2015)*

### *Steps:*
####
- The csv file containing the Terrorism Data is read.
- Computed the number of terrorist attacks on top 4 terrorist hit countries as per 
  [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Terrorism_Index) by type of target.
- Plotted the graph to help better visualize the above information.

### *Outputs:*
- Plot File : [Top4propertyattack](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_5/png/top4propertyattack.png)
- Excel Files : [Data_Iraq](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_5/excel/data_iraq.xlsx), [Data_Afghanistan](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_5/excel/data_afghanistan.xlsx), [Data_Nigeria](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_5/excel/data_nigeria.xlsx), [Data_Syria](https://github.com/prashantvikramsingh/singh_prashant-vikram_spring2017/tree/master/final/analysis/ana_5/excel/data_syria.xlsx)

### *Conclusion:*
#### *It can be seen from the above graphs that:*
- The top four most affected countries by terrorist attacks as per wikipedia has more percentage of attacks in 
  normal areas as compared to the attacks on government or militry infrastructure.
- This pattern clearly bifurcate with the terrorist motives to protest against the wrongdoing that 
  they have suffered from the political or militry establishment in a country.
- They are attacking and killing normal innocent people in the name of Jihad.
- These attacks not only make a country poorer but also injest the fearsome feeling of being unsafe.
